# numbering-plan

This library helps you migrate exiting phone numbers format to new phone number formats.

## Usage

First you start by defining the migration rules for you country

```kotlin
val ivoryCoastPlanFactory: CountryPlan = CountryPlan.Builder()
    .setOldPhoneNumberSize(8)
    .setInternationalCallingCode("225")
    .setDigitMapperPosition(Position.START) // Position.END
    .setMigrationType(MigrationType.PREFIX) // MigrationType.POSTFIX
    .setPrefixesMapper(
      mapOf(
        "07" to "07", // Orange
        "08" to "07", // eg: 08 XX XX XX => 07 08 XX XX XX (if MigrationType.prefix is used) => 08 XX XX XX 07 (if MigrationType.postfix is used)
        "09" to "07",
        "04" to "05", // MTN
        "05" to "05",
        "06" to "05",
        "01" to "01", // MOOV
        "02" to "01",
        "03" to "01"
      )
    ).build()
```

Then you pass those rules to `NumberingPlan` and you can start the migration:

```kotlin
val ivoryCoastPlanFactory: CountryPlan = ...
val numberingPlan = NumberingPlan(ivoryCoastPlanFactory)
val newPhoneNumbers = numberingPlan.migrate(mapOf(
  "userId-1" to "08060709",
  "userId-2" to "06060709",
  "userId-3" to "03060701",
  "userId-4" to " 03 060 701 ",
  "userId-5" to " 03-060-701",
  "userId-6" to "zezae/03-060-701",
  "userId-7" to ")'.03-060-701"
))
```

After the migration `newPhoneNumbers` will be equal to:

```kotlin
mapOf(
  "userId-1" to "002250708060709",
  "userId-2" to "002250506060709",
  "userId-3" to "002250103060701",
  "userId-4" to "002250103060701",
  "userId-5" to "002250103060701"
)
```

Invalid phone numbers are removed.

## Known limitations

- [x] Migrates only valid phone numbers.
- [x] Can add new digits before or after the old phone number. We decided to not handle in between insertions.
- [x] Can only look for digits to replace at the start or the end of old phone numbers. We think this shouldnâ€™t be a problem (generally) but as of now we decided to not handle such cases.
- [x] It is synchronous. This is a choice that will let you pick the any library you want to handle async tasks.
